            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I was inspired to develop this website as a tool for housing navigation from my prior experience as a
                Housing Specialist at a non-profit where my role was to assist individuals experiencing
                homelessness in obtaining long-term housing.
                This web application was created to assist those with limited resources in communicating their needs for
                housing to their
                landlords, whether it be drafting a well-written letter of a tenant's rights violation, a letter of
                advocacy for an individual with a criminal background, or just answering general fair housing questions.
                Users can copy and paste the AI-generated responses in their correspondents to their landlord or housing
                provider. Tenant rights are frequently overlooked simply because tenants do not know their rights or
                how
                to properly communicate their concerns to their housing providers, and they oftentimes fall back into a
                cycle
                of homelessness because of it.</p>

        <div class="what-is-it">
            <h2>What exactly does this website do?</h2>
            <p> This site uses artificial intelligence from ChatGPT's API to generate letter templates, housing
                resources, or answer general housing law questions. The below templates are prompts that I have used
                directly with my past clients.

        <div class="how-to-use">
            <h2>How to use:</h2>
            <p>Copy and paste the question template into the terminal below, change any necessary details specific to
                your situation, and hit enter. Use the response for your own benefit!
